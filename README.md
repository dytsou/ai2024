## HW1  Face Detection 
Use Viola-Jones algorithm to detect faces in images.

## HW2 Route Planning
Use BFS, DFS, UCS, A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a map. And also use A* algorithm to find the fastest path between two points on a map.

## HW3 Pacman
Use Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax algorithm and evaluation function to implement the pacman game.

## HW4 Reinforcement Learning
Use Q-learning algorithm to implement Taxi-v3 game, CartPole-v0 game and use DQN algorithm to implement CartPole-v0 game. Compare the performance of Q-learning and DQN algorithm.

## HW5 Improve LLM Prompt
Design a task for the LLM model and improve the model's performance.
